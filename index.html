        <h2>JavaScript Functions - The Interesting Stuff</h2>

            <h3>Scope</h3>

                <p>
                    Global variables, variables declared outside of functions, are available <em>everywhere</em>. The advantage of this is that you have the abilit to access these variables at any point in a program. However, this methodology is <strong>NOT</strong> scalable and should be avoided. Variables should live at a local level within functions whenever possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The JavaScript engine will look in the current function for a variable. If the variable is not found it will proceed to the next outer function and so on. It will continue this search until reaching the global scope level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of the day the big idea is this: <strong>global variables can lead to messy code, poor naming conventions, and conflicting code. </strong>
                </p>

            <h3>Hoisting</h3>

                <p>
                    This was something new. Every course I took centered around JavaScript did not address hoisting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Important Concept:</strong> JavaScript will hoist function and variable declarations to the top of the current scope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>However,</strong> variable <em>assignments</em> are not hoisted. Meaning if you happen to declare a variable used in a function at the end of the function, it will not work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Declare functions and variables at the top of your scripts, so the syntax and behavior are consistent with each other.
                </p>

            <h3>Function Expressions</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Function Expression:</strong> When a function is assigned to a variable. The function can be named, or anonymous. Use the variable name to call a function defined in a function expression.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, if you're writing a function that you're 100% certain will only ever be used in that instance then you can write the function <em>inline</em>.
            </p>
