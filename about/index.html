    <h3>Analyst to Engineer.</h3>

    <p>
    I started my career out as a financial analyst. Wrangling massive amounts of data manually, building out Excel workbooks, summarizing data into a consumable format, analyzing the data, and documenting the whole process. All of this in hopes that somebody could recreate the same report, with new data, the following week. Unfortunately, that "somebody" always seemed to be me, and new requests continued to come my way.
    </p>

    <p>
    As an analyst, my goal was to automate as much as possible without sacrificing any quality in work. This led me to pursue additional technologies: PowerPivot, PowerBI, PowerQuery, SQL. Anything that could eliminate manual steps â€” I learned and squeezed into a process I had created.
    </p>

    <p>
    This passion for automation and solving complex problems continued to grow and I dove deeper into the technological rabbit hole. When I saw what could be achieved using programming and algorithms, it was game over. I knew that I wanted to pursue software engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
    I soon began taking online courses to build my programming foundation. Eventually I was fortunate enough to gain full-time work as a software engineer and enroll part-time in Oregon State's Computer Science program.
    </p>

    <p>
    Everyday my passion for software engineering continues to grow. There is always more to learn, new problems to solve, and solutions to build. I couldn't be more excited for the future.
